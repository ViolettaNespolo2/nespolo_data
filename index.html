	<h3 id="left"><h3>Back in 2007, Micheal Bloomberg initiated the one million trees plan with the aim of improving the quality of life in the city he was administering as Mayor: New York City. This was accomplished in 2015, a solution that according to scientists will impact positively on the city's environment and combat pollution caused by carbon dioxide in the cheapest way possible.  
	</p>
	<p> As of 2019, there are 5.2 million trees in New York City, according to Treesny.org. Of this total amount, around 675,000 are street trees, while the rest are located in parks, playgrounds, natural areas and unique public spaces. 
	</p>
	<p> In 2015 a Tree Census helped map out trees in NYC and map them out.

	Manhattan counts 65.423 trees but there is disparity as to which ares have more or less trees. Such areas are for example the Garment District in Midtown Manhattan, SoHo and Tribeca. This is clearly visibile on the map.</p>
	<p>The main issues that affect this are:
	<li>Hollow ground that doesn't allow a tree to grow strong roots. 
	<li>Sun light that allows the plant's healthy growth.
	<li>Care provided by local volunteers.</p>
	<p>
	In areas such as Tribeca, where trees and green areas are scarce it appears that "People are ferociously protective of their greenland," said Pam Frederick, a resident of Tribeca and manager of the local blog. 
</p>
	<p>This is definitely the case with Finn Square, where the small strip of land is cared by a group of volunteers. ‘Friends of Finn Square’ board members put in their free time to cultivate something anyone can enjoy. This requires a lot of effort, “there are several problems gardening wise: the soil is very shallow, there are tree roots everywhere, there is a lack of manpower and sun,” said Jessica Raimi, head of the board.
