	<h3 id="left"><h3>Trump has been waging his war on China by putting into effects tariffs on imported goods. On September 1st, 2019, he had implemented enough tariffs that made "the majority of goods imported to the United States from China subject to import taxes," as The New York Times wrote in an article. What appeared clear was that the tariffs impacted a lot American citizens' welfare. A research conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research, published in March 2019, provided empirical evidence to support the thesis by looking at data from 2018. "Using standard economic methods, we find that the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018," it states. The research further says that "Increases in trade barriers can reduce welfare by restricting consumer's ability to purchase new imported varieties. ... consumers benefit from trade liberalizations because it gives consumers access to varieties of products."
	<p>
	On August 20, 2019, the Office of the United States Trade Representative published a 'Notice of Modification of Section 301 Action: China's Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation', which stated "In accordance with the specific direction of the President, the U.S. Trade Representative  has determined ... additional duties of 10 percent ad valorem on products of China classified in the tariff subheadings." These tariffs impacted goods such as flat-panel TV sets, flash memory devices, speakers, headphones, printers, bedding and footwear, as published by Reuters recently.</p>
	<p>
	By looking at the same data used in the research, data collected by the United States Census Bureau on US International Trade in Goods and Services, we can note two relevant facts: first of all we can see that in just one month, from August to September, specific import categories have decreased more than others.

	<p>
	Secondly, by looking in detail at the categories some of the largest decreases correspond with the categories impacted by the tariffs on China. </p>

	<p>
	The same data split by country provides an insight into how the first quarter of 2019 saw a 15.5% decrease in imports from China compared to the previous quarter. </p>
	<p>

</p>
	<p>
	Nevertheless, when looking at the balance of imports versus exports between 2017 and 2019, the balance has increasingly favored imports: the gap grew by 11% in 2018 and by 5% in 2019.</p>

</p>
<p>This goes to support the previously mentioned research's conclusion that cutting imports from a specific country doesn't cut imports overall, rather it encourages other countries to sell more of their product and raise prices.</p>
